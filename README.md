# Debugger
Debugger is a 2D web-based game where the player must elminate an army of bugs threatening UCSC's Science and Engineering Library. These bugs pop out from behind trees, fences, and other objects then disappear. The player must use the mouse that is in the shape of a crosshair to shoot down the bugs. When shot, these bugs are not just insects, but rather common programming bugs. This game is meant to act as a stress-reliever for students when they struggle with programming assignments and computer science as a whole.

The main branch is Develop.
